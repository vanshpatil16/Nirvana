/**
 * LAND POTENTIAL — data contract.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE USING ANY NUMBER IN THIS FEATURE.
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The candidate parcels in `landPotentialData.ts` are SYNTHETIC. They are
 * generated in code over real Pune-area coordinates so the prototype has
 * something to draw and assess. They are NOT cadastral parcels, NOT government
 * land records, and NOT derived from any land registry.
 *
 * The rule this module encodes, and that every consumer must preserve:
 *
 *   - A parcel's GEOMETRY is synthetic (DEMO).
 *   - A parcel's OBSERVED CONDITION is synthetic (DEMO) unless a real source is
 *     later connected, in which case the field carries its own status.
 *   - OWNERSHIP IS NEVER INFERRED FROM APPEARANCE. `ownershipStatus` is either
 *     supplied by a connected source or is "unknown", and "unknown" suppresses
 *     the availability factor rather than defaulting to government.
 *   - SUITABILITY IS MODELLED. It is a screening score, not a probability of
 *     success and not a recommendation.
 *
 * Every score is expressed as "X / 100" with a named basis. Nothing here is a
 * percentage of anything real.
