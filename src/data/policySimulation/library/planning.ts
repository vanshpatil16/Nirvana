    description:
      "A zonal master plan divides a metropolitan region into zones and prescribes the land use and development permissions for each, so that the metropolitan plan, the intermediate plans and the local plans work to one allocation instead of contradicting each other. Its practical effect in the model is that the unit in which a development sits determines what it may become, and the reviewed land use map that accompanies it determines what the recorded class is chasing. The specific zonal schedule in the source folder is partly image-based; the numeric permissions below are modelling values and should be replaced with the schedule figures for the zone being evaluated.",
